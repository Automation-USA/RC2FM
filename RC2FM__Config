#Name: RC2FM__Config History: Created by Automation USA - Julio Toledo Created: 7-3-2016 Last Modified: 5-31-2017 (added $$showDialogs variable) Purpose: Initializes global variables that specify dynamic paths to fields, layouts, and table occurrences required by RC2FM Parameters: None Important Notes: We've made every effort to make the RC2FM integration as dynamic and easily configurable as possible so it can be easily transferred to any FileMaker solution. However there are some script steps such as "Insert from URL" which in FileMaker versions 15 and earlier require hard coded paths. Be sure to review all scripts when pasting/importing them into your solution.
